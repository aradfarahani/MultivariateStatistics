## Geostatistics Projects

## Introduction
This repository contains various geostatistics projects that I have worked on. Each project focuses on different aspects of geostatistics, including Bayesian mapping, collocated cokriging, kriging, and more. The aim is to apply geostatistical methods to real-life data and analyze spatial patterns.

## Project Structure
- **/Geostatistics/bayesmapping/**
  - `bayesmapping.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for Bayesian mapping.
  - `BLdata.csv`: Data file used in Bayesian mapping.
  - `BLgrid.csv`: Grid data for Bayesian mapping.

- **/Geostatistics/collocatedcokriging/**
  - `collocatedcokriging.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for collocated cokriging.
  - `cluster1.out`, `true.out`, `varcalc_Cluster.out`, `varcalc_Cross.out`, `varcalc_YDATA.out`, `x.out`, `y.out`, `ydata.out`: Output files from collocated cokriging analysis.

- **/Geostatistics/introkrigingplan/**
  - `introkrigingplan.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook introducing kriging.

- **/Geostatistics/mds/**
  - `mds.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for multidimensional scaling.
  - `mining_company_data.csv`: Data file for multidimensional scaling.

- **/Geostatistics/nuggeteffect/**
  - `nuggeteffect.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook analyzing the nugget effect.

- **/Geostatistics/pairwiserelative/**
  - `pairwiserelative.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for pairwise relative analysis.

## Usage
To run the notebooks, you need to have Jupyter installed. You can install Jupyter using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Navigate to the directory containing the notebook you want to run and start Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Open the notebook in your browser and run the cells to execute the code.
